WP_Taxonomy_Chained_Select
==========================

Adds a shortcode/function for simple multi-purpose 2-Level Chained Select for hierarchical taxonomies in WordPress, w/jQuery show/hide for sub-categories. 

Put this in your theme's "functions.php", stick it into a plugin, or just put the file somewher and use include() - then you can call up your taxonomies with shortcodes or a function call to include it in forms for various purposes.

I was frustrated by the complete absence of chained/cascading select plugins that just let you insert taxonomies willy nilly into any form.

They all seem to presume you're interested in a few specific uses - usually archive navigation. 

There was nothing for developers who just wanted to pretty up their own forms.

I needed a two-level chained select to attach taxonomies to a custom post type via a front-end form, so I wrote this.


COMING SOON:
- make hierarchy depth configurable instead of presuming 2 levels.
- adding attributes to allow users to add custom javascript for events via shortcode
- rolling it into a plugin with the obligatory nav widget for end-users
- interpretive dance to code poetry
